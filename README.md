A list of snippets made by me for use with Discord's mods.

You may not redistribute the code, modify it to redistribute it (modifying it for personal use is fine), or claim it as your own.

If you found these anywhere that's not this GitHub page or by anyone that's not me (Shylke), know they're stealing it.
